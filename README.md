## Pull those mobs into me!

Intended for dungeon use when people/tanks pull the mobs away from you, JUST as you get your proc..

This addons fixes that, so that you YELL when you Bladestorm, so people in your party pulls the mobs close to you.


### Points to make

* At the moment, the addon will yell regardless of being in a party or not. This will be a setting in the future
